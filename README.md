# ðŸš€ Deloitte Virtual Internship - Factory Down Time Analysis using Tableau

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project was completed as part of the **Deloitte Virtual Internship**. The goal is to analyze factory down time using **telemetry data**, create calculated fields, and develop an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to gain insights into machine performance.

## ðŸ“Š Key Tasks
1. **Data Import**:  
   - Downloaded and unzipped the dataset (`daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip`).  
   - Imported it into **Tableau** for analysis.  

2. **Calculated Field - "Unhealthy"**:  
   - Created a new measure **"Unhealthy"** which assigns a value of **10 minutes** for every **unhealthy status** (representing potential downtime).  

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Created a **bar chart** showing **down time per factory**.  
   - Created a **bar chart** showing **down time per device type**.  

4. **Interactive Dashboard**:  
   - Combined both charts in a **Tableau Dashboard**.  
   - Enabled **filtering**, so selecting a factory updates the down time per device type.  

5. **Final Analysis & Submission**:  
   - Selected the factory with the **highest downtime**.  
   - Captured a **screenshot** of the interactive dashboard.
